# labeltable
#A side script I worked on to assist with asset labeling. This was Intended to be integrated with an asset 
#management system and to be used for multiple TV news shows.



This is my first original program idea and it is meant to be a simple label system.

Choose a combination of the three menus to create a unique key to save the layout underneath.  If preferred variation
is not included in the list, you can type a new addition in the variation field box and it will be included in 
the "Variation" menu the next time the program is opened

Fill out the fields, check selected boxes, and hit save.  This saves the layout to the shelve file using 
concatenated 3 word string of values from the menuselections as a key.

Find any combination of menu selections previously saved, and load the layout using the load button

This will populate text boxes and check boxes with the stored value.

The send button was intended to send the values to the asset management system, but the back end was never developed.

Now the send button takes all values with checked boxes and opens a pop-up box.

All and any feedback/criticism is welcome.  Thank you!
